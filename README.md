# Stolen Token Tracker

This smart contract serves as a mechanism to track stolen ERC20 tokens and can be used to freeze or blacklist the thief's address, making it impossible for them to transfer the stolen tokens.

#Features

*Blacklisting of addresses: A function to blacklist an address, making it impossible for the blacklisted address to transfer the stolen tokens.

*Unblacklisting of addresses: A function to unblacklist an address, allowing the address to transfer the tokens again.

*Check if an address is blacklisted: A function to check if an address is blacklisted.

*Freeze Tokens: A function to freeze the tokens of blacklisted address.
Usage

Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
Use the blacklist() function to blacklist the thief's address.
Use the isBlacklisted() function to check if an address is blacklisted.
Use the unblacklist() function to unblacklist an address.
Use the freezeTokens() function to freeze the tokens of blacklisted address.

# Security

The contract has been designed with the following security considerations in mind:

The owner of the contract is the only one who can blacklist and unblacklist the addresses.
The contract only allows blacklisting or unblacklisting an address once.
Stolen Tokens can be frozen only if the address is blacklisted.

# Limitations

The contract does not interact with the ERC20 token contract to freeze the tokens, it's out of scope of smart contract development.
The contract cannot extract stolen tokens from a thief's address, as smart contracts can only execute the code that is written in them and cannot interact with the outside world.

# Test

The contract has been tested with the test script provided. It's important to test the contract thoroughly with different inputs and test edge cases as well.

# Disclaimer

This is just a sample smart contract and should not be used in a production environment without proper testing and security audits.
